# guess-game

### Task:
Implement a Guess Game Client and Server using TCP.

Guess Game: the server picks a random number between 1 and 9. The client has 3 attempts to
guess the picked number. The game ends if the client has guessed the picked number (client wins!)
or if the client has not guessed the picked number after the third try (server wins!).
